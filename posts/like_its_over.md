Next time, we take the front stage. What did I do as a midfielder? Their weak attack couldn't even get that ball past the center line for most of the time. Meanwhile, by putting our star players on defence ensured that _we_ don't get past _their_ superb defence. However, they managed to accidently put up a goal, and the balance tilted in their favor.

The strategy must change. Forget that coach. Never has he played a game in Downtown. I bet they don't even kick the football properly at his countryside.

He says, _"Save your castle"_, but whom should we save it from?. We might be the first team to ever lose a match on this ground because the team's defence was strong.
